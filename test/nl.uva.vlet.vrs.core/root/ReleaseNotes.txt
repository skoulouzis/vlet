=== Release notes for 1.4.1 ===

This is a bugfix release.

Updates:
===
- Fixed the asynchronous srmLs bug. The SRM API now supports asynchronous 
  polling enabled in newer versions of dCache.  
- Added extra 'srmCount' and 'srmOffset' parameters to SRM VRLs. 
  This way an SRM directory with more then 1000 entries can be listed using urils.sh 
  as follows:  
  
     urils.sh srm://srm.grid.sara.nl:8443/data/pvier/ptdeboer/bigdir?srmCount=100&srmOffset=200  

=== Release notes for 1.4.0 ===

Features
===
- Script urils.sh -l <uri> now also works if <uri> isn't a directory but a plain file.
- Script uristat.sh also works on non file resources.   
- The navigation bar now has a completion "combo" box which remembers typed in locations. 
- Added support for certificate files ending with ".crt". Clicking on them will
  start a Certificate Viewer which ask the user if the certificate needs to be 
  imported into the trusted certificate store. 
  Right clicking on a .crt file will show a "certs" submenu with certificate options. 
- When browsing an SSH location, a VLterm can be started directly with the new menu 
  option "Open VLTerm".  
- Prototype implementation of iRods plugin. Supports only minimal file browsing
  and up- and downloading.  
  No optimization nor iRods specific features have been implemented. 

Bug fixes:
===
- Fixed bugs which could occur when viewing similar resources in the ResourceTree. 
  Both subtrees should now be updated correctly.
- Changing the VO field of a proxy will now trigger a connection reset so the new 
  VO of the new proxy will be used.    
- Added new Terena root CA certificate to the default certificate store. 
  Some dutchgrid sites use this new (root) certificate. 
- For an overview of all bug fixes see the bug tracker. 


=== Release notes for 1.3.2 ===

Updates:  
===
- LFC replica methods have been improved and some bugs have been fixed.
  Also the logging when performing file transfers has been updated.  
- A new distribution is available: the vlet-sdk. This is a minimized distribution
  containing only the virtual file system (VFS) and a stripped VBrowser without
  any extra plugins which can be used for example inside a (tomcat) web service. 
  
Plugins: 
- The new Moteur plugin (2.0) is available in this release. 

API: 
===
- The VRS/VFS has been cleaned up. Some internal methods have been renamed (old 
  method names have been deprecated) and the (javadoc) documentation has been updated.
- All classes in the legacy 'kbtools' now have 'nl.uva.vlet.kbtools.*' as package
  prefix instead of 'nl.uva.vlet.tools.*' to avoid confusion.    
- DBII interface has been cleaned up and 'public' methods can now be used in 
  in custom plugins.    

=== Release notes for 1.3.1 ===

Please send bug reports, questions or other feedback to: vlet-users@lists.vl-e.nl. 
This list is moderated, so any message from a new sender might take a few days before
it will be accepted. Follow up messages will be automatically accepted.    

This is a bugfix release.

Updates:
===
- Fixed BDII bug (again). The BDII query still relied on the 1.2 Glue scheme to get 1.3 Glue objects. 
  This has been fixed and new Storage Elements should appear under Grid Neighbourhood. 
  

=== Release notes for 1.3.0 ===

Updates: 
===
- Added "Force Delete" for LFC which removes LFC entries even when the status of the 
  replicas can't be determined. 
- Added LB Resources (Logging and Bookkeeping) to GridNeighbourhood. 
  LB Resources also show up as logical childs under WMS Resources. 
- urils.sh script now supports 'listing' of LB resources. 
  The resulting names will be the user jobs as registered at the LB Server. 
- User certificate authentication to grid enabled websites (https) now works.
  After creating a proxy, the user certificate information will be used when
  contacting the remote web site.
- Grid proxy dialog now supports VO Roles and VO Groups. 
  To specify a role, just fill it in at he "VO Role" field.  
  To specify a "VO Group" just use "<VO Name>/<VO Group>" at the VO Name field. 
  For example "pvier/test" (don't use a slash before the VO Name).  
- The implementations of SRM and LFC have been further improved to be robust in 
  the case of errors or temporarily service failures. 
- UserGuide has been updated to include changes from 1.2.0 and 1.3.0.
    
Tools:
===            
- Added JGridStart under "Tools->Grid Utils"
- Added Jython examples for 'urils' and 'lfccp' which can respectively list remote URI
  locations and copy to an LFC location (script includes example how to specify properties.).    
- The scripts uricp.sh,uristat.sh and urils.sh can be used as script interface 
  to the VRS (and VFS).  

API: 
===
- The BDII code has been updated to support the 1.3 Glue schema as well.
  This to support the new PoC update.  
- Updated WMS and LB API now fully available in the VLET API. 
  Experimental job submission and monitoring plugins are available.
  See module: nl.uva.vlet.examples/src/example.vjs.TestSubmit.java    
- https/ssl API has been updated to grid proxies and non grid proxy authentication 
  when setting up https/ssl connections. See SSLContextManager and CertificateStore classes.
  Grid and SSL certificate management has been centralized in one API.  
- GridProxy now can use different proxy providers.   
  The default one is globus (No other proxy providers have been implemented yet).
- ClassLogger API now available which extends java.util.logging.Logger

Plugins:
 - The Computis imzML plugin has been added to the vlet-all distribution. 
     
Bug fixes: 
===
- When copying an LFC file which has more then one replica, under some
  conditions, only one replica was tried. If that failed the copy loop stopped.
  This has been fixed so multiple replicas, if available, will be tried. 
- WMS now correctly queries the LB Services that are associated with that WMS.
- LB Server 2.0 is supported as well.    
- The "Overwrite All" feature from copy dialog didn't work. 
- Logging output/warning statements from LoboBrowser have been reduced. 
- See bugtracker for all bugs.
- The layout of the Grid Proxy dialog has been improved to work better on MacOs.
