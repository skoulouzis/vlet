=== Release notes for 1.5.0 ===

This is an administrative update. 
Project has been registered at sourceforge.net
Software repository used in now SVN. 
See: 
- https://sourceforge.net/projects/vlet/

Currently only "core" modules are supported. 

=== Release notes for 1.4.1/1.4.0 ===

This is a bugfix release.

Updates:
===
- Fixed the asynchronous srmLs bug. The SRM API now supports asynchronous 
  polling enabled in newer versions of dCache.  
- Added extra 'srmCount' and 'srmOffset' parameters to SRM VRLs. 
  This way an SRM directory with more then 1000 entries can be listed using urils.sh 
  as follows:  
  
     urils.sh srm://srm.grid.sara.nl:8443/data/pvier/ptdeboer/bigdir?srmCount=100&srmOffset=200  

=== Release notes for 1.4.0 ===

Features
===
- Script urils.sh -l <uri> now also works if <uri> isn't a directory but a plain file.
- Script uristat.sh also works on non file resources.   
- The navigation bar now has a completion "combo" box which remembers typed in locations. 
- Added support for certificate files ending with ".crt". Clicking on them will
  start a Certificate Viewer which ask the user if the certificate needs to be 
  imported into the trusted certificate store. 
  Right clicking on a .crt file will show a "certs" submenu with certificate options. 
- When browsing an SSH location, a VLterm can be started directly with the new menu 
  option "Open VLTerm".  
- Prototype implementation of iRods plugin. Supports only minimal file browsing
  and up- and downloading.  
  No optimization nor iRods specific features have been implemented. 

Bug fixes:
===
- Fixed bugs which could occur when viewing similar resources in the ResourceTree. 
  Both subtrees should now be updated correctly.
- Changing the VO field of a proxy will now trigger a connection reset so the new 
  VO of the new proxy will be used.    
- Added new Terena root CA certificate to the default certificate store. 
  Some dutchgrid sites use this new (root) certificate. 
- For an overview of all bug fixes see the bug tracker.
